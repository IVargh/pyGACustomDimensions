  "tagline": "This set of Python scripts allows for the mass creation and modification of Google Analytics custom dimensions, using the Management API.",
  "body": "### Welcome.\r\nI work with Google Analytics a lot and I have customers working with many custom dimensions.\r\n \r\nUnfortunately, for customers with heavy property structure requirements, (ensure a tagging strategy across multiple brands and countries for instance) sites and apps need to implement ranges of custom dimensions (and metrics to a lesser extent).\r\n \r\nLet’s say for instance that brand flagship websites use the same first 10 custom dimensions with strict compliance on these values.\r\nNow let’s say that local versions of the same brand are not *required* to implement the first 10 custom dimensions but they can merrily use custom dims 11-20 (or higher if Premium). One of these days they will end up playing ball and eventually implement 1 through 10. Some day.\r\nAnyhow, the issue in the above scenario is that you have to create 10 blank /inactive custom dimensions before you can start defining 11-20\r\n \r\nFor the time being, using the Management API, one can create custom dimensions (and their indexes) in a linear fashion using *insert* but one can also modify existing custom dimensions using *update* or *patch* and passing along the customDimensionId parameter. \r\n \r\nThe scripts in this project offer an alternative, which is to run *insert* loops through the API to create 20/200 inactive spare custom dimensions and then using a CSV parser to use *update* to create actual custom dimension definitions.\r\n\r\nOne script can pull all custom dimensions from your account and dump them as CSV files.\r\nA second script auto-populates all custom dimensions in your target property.\r\nA third script uses a CSV file (hint hint) to upload and update custom dimensions for a given dimension.\r\n\r\n### Author\r\nThis project was authored by Julien Coquet (@analyticsftw), a Google Analytics consultant, certified partner and Top Contributor.\r\nFind me on Twitter at https://twitter.com/juliencoquet\r\n",
